# Stock Price Prediction using Time Series Forecasting Transformer


## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project applies **time-series forecasting** techniques to predict monthly stock prices of companies listed on the National Stock Exchange (NSE) using historical data from 1990 to 2021. The core of the project is a **Transformer-based deep learning architecture** that captures long-term dependencies and trends in stock prices. The model leverages advanced **feature engineering** and **optimization** to deliver highly accurate predictions, aiding investors in making informed decisions.
